I've recently decided that I'll be paying for Youtube Premium. I've long sat on the fence on this one. I've debated why I should be paying for something that used to be free. I've debated if it is wise to give money to a monopolistic tech giant like Google. In this post I'll go through my thought process on why I ultimately decided to go for the Premium subscription.

## Enjoyment of content
I enjoy watching YouTube. There are several content creators that I love to watch. There is a wide range of interesting topics that you can access through YouTube, and not through any other medium or on any other platform.

## Support for independent creators
I realize that creators on YouTube are not technically independent because they depend heavily on YouTube and thus on Google. However, they are independent in the sense that some of them don't have to work full-time jobs. They create YouTube content full-time. This is possible because they get payed through YouTube for their work, based on the amount of views they get. I love that I can support that. I love that I can make someone elses dream of independence come true by watching their great content. I love that they can keep providing great content because of this.

Even if they don't work on their channels full-time. It's still great that they can make some money on the side by creating interesting or entertaining content for others to watch.

## Ads
Ads are a cancer that is ruining the world. It allows sub-par businesses to peddle their sub-par goods and services just because they have a budget to throw at their target audience. It allows monopolistic tech giants to grow larger and larger because the crowd can't resist the 'free' service. All it costs them is all of their privacy and some time watching ads. They don't value privacy and they have time to spare, so that's a good deal to most people.

YouTube is riddled with ads. They hook you in with an interesting thumbnail, title and preview. Then they show you 30 seconds of ads so that you have to evaluate if the video really is worth waiting on while watching some stupid promotion. While I love the fact that someone is getting payed for the work they put into creating the video that I'm watching, I hate that I'm sponsoring both Google and the stupid company that created the ad.

Also another reason why I was hesitant on buying YouTube Premium. In the past couple of months, Google has steadily increased the amount of ads they show you. While it started with one ad that you could skip after 5 seconds before the video, you now get two ads at the start, two or three in the middle of the video, and another one or two at the end. It's insufferable. It also feels like they're trying to bully you into buying their premium membership, a truly terrible practice. Still it made me evaluate my options. I could suffer through 5-second skippable ads, but not through this onslaught of bullshit every time I opened a video. 

## Monopolistic tech giant Google
Their bullying practice is something that shows the power of monopolistic tech giants. You have nowhere else to go, so they can basically just do whatever they want, charge whatever they want and make you do whatever they want. They grew big with a good service, and now that they're the only one left in the space, they'll squize you until they've got every drop of money that the can.

This all brings us in a catch-22. I don't want to leave YouTube, because my favorite content creators are there. They're there because it gives them an audience and an income. They're not leaving until their audience, and thus their income, dissapear. While it might happen that slowly people will start moving away from YouTube, it's going to take a very long time, if it ever happens.

## Conclusion
So, I want to keep enjoying my favorite YouTube channels, while not sponsoring the ad market. YouTube premium allows me to do that. The only downside is that I'm still sponsoring a tech giant. I'll take that tradeoff for now. This might change once Google decides to compensate creators less, or if they make the subscription more expensive, or if there comes a better alternative to YouTube. 

For now I'll pay for this subscription and enjoy my time without the toxicity of ads.
