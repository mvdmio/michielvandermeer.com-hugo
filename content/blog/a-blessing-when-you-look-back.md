Life, when walking through<br>
is like a barren wasteland.<br>
It takes great effort<br>
and you often wonder why.<br>

But when you take the time<br>
to look back over your shoulder.<br>
You see that the wasteland behind<br>
was a field of grass<br>
with trees to hide you from the burning sun.<br>

Carry that knowledge with you.<br>
Know that were you are now<br>
is not a waste nor tragedy,<br>
but a blessing the like you can only see<br>
when you look back after climbing the hill in front of you.<br>
