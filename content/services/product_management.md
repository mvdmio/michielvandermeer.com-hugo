I can get development of your products off the ground, or back on track. No matter if you have an organization that is well-versed in Agile methodologies or are just starting to pick it up, I know how to get organizations and teams moving in the right direction.

I have more than 4 years experience as a professional SCRUM product owner and multiple more years of experence as a Lead Software Developer. I've worked on high-performance and high-tech systems in the Shipping and Horticulture industries.

Please send me an email at [michiel@mvdm.io](mailto:michiel@mvdm.io) with details of your project so that we can start working together.

I'm currently **available** for both short and long term projects.
