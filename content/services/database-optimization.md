Most application slow down as they're being developed. Most of the time this is because poor database optimizations. Most software developers can develop queries that work, but not queries or schemas that perform well. I can help you optimize your databases so that they perform as you expect.

I have more than 10 years experience as a professional software developer. I've worked on high-performance and high-tech systems in the Shipping and Horticulture industries. During that time I've worked with many databases: Oracle, MSSQL, AzureSQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL. Obvioiusly all of them needed to perform, so I've learned a lot about SQL database optimization while getting those databases to perform up to specifications.

Please send me an email at [michiel@mvdm.io](mailto:michiel@mvdm.io) with details of your project so that we can start working together.

I'm currently **available** for both short and long term projects.
