I can help you implement new features in existing projects or even start entirely new projects. I also have an extensive network of experts to help out with any problem that I can't tackle myself. If needed I can also come by additional developers to help out with bigger projects.

I have more than 10 years experience as a professional software developer. I've worked on high-performance and high-tech systems in the Shipping and Horticulture industries. I have extended experience in multpile programming languages: C#, Java, Ruby, Javascript and HTML/CSS.

Please send me an email at [michiel@mvdm.io](mailto:michiel@mvdm.io) with details of your project so that we can start working together.

I'm currently **available** for both short and long term projects.
