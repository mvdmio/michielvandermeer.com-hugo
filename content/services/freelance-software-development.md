I can help you implement new features in existing projects or even start entirely new projects. I also have an extensive network of experts to help out with any problem that I can't tackle myself. If needed I can also come by additional developers to help out with bigger projects.

## What can you expect?

When the project is clear I can usually get up-and-running very quickly. Actual duration of the project depends intirely on what needs to be done, the state of the current product and the amount of interaction required with stakeholders and other developers.

I will always deliver high-quality software that is tested both with manual and automated tests. I will deliver quickly, but not quicker than possible. I usually give pointers on areas that could use some refactoring to other developers; of course it's up to them to do something with that or not.

Projects can run from weeks to about a year; depending on what kind of project it is.

## About me

I have more than 10 years experience as a professional software developer. I've worked on high-performance and high-tech systems in the Shipping and Horticulture industries. I have extended experience in multpile programming languages: C#, Java, Ruby, Javascript and HTML/CSS.

You can find all of my previous projects [here](/projects). In this case, I think the [PSA Quaycrane OCR](/projects/psa-quaycrane-ocr/), [ECT Electronic Order Handling](/projects/ect-electronic-order-handling-system/) and [24green Climate Computer](/projects/climate-compute-24green/) projects are especially relevant.

## Availability

Please send me an email at [michiel@mvdm.io](mailto:michiel@mvdm.io) with details of your project so that we can start working together.

I'm currently **available** for both short and long term projects.
