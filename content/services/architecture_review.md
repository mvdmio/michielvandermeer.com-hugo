I can help you review the software- and service architecture that your development team has built. This way you can be sure that you are getting the most out of the hardware that your services are running on.

I have more than 10 years experience as a professional software developer. I've worked on high-performance and high-tech systems in the Shipping and Horticulture industries. During that time I've designed systems that run on various platforms: from cloud-hosted services to distributed services that run on self-hosted VMs.

Please send me an email at [michiel@mvdm.io](mailto:michiel@mvdm.io) with details of your project so that we can start working together.

I'm currently **available** for both short and long term projects.
