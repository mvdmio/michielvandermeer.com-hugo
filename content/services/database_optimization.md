I have more than 10 years experience as a professional software developer. I've worked on high-performance and high-tech systems in the Shipping and Horticulture industries. During that time I've worked with many databases: Oracle, MSSQL, AzureSQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL. Obvioiusly all of them needed to perform, so I've learned a lot about SQL database optimization while getting those databases to perform up to specifications.

I can help you optimize your databases so that they perform as you expect as well.

Please send me an email at [michiel@mvdm.io](mailto:michiel@mvdm.io) with details of your project so that we can start working together.

I'm currently **available** for both short and long term projects.
