I can get development of your products off the ground, or back on track. No matter if you have an organization that is well-versed in Agile methodologies or are just starting to pick it up, I know how to get organizations and teams moving in the right direction.

## What can you expect?

I'll start with assessing the current state of the project and the effectiveness of the development team. With that information I'll devise a plan for areas that need improvement, if any. I'll then make sure the development team have a clear product backlog that they can use to plan their iterations. I will organize regular meetings with stakeholders, both inside the company and outside. From there I will make sure that both the development team and the organization are clear on the direction the product is heading and when to expect new deliveries.

Interim projects are usually on the longer side, starting at around 3 months and running up to multiple years, depending on the size of the product, the development team and what you, the client, needs.

## About me

I have more than 4 years experience as a professional SCRUM product owner and multiple more years of experence as a Lead Software Developer. I've worked on high-performance and high-tech systems in the Shipping and Horticulture industries.

You can find all my previous projects [here](/projects). In this case, I think the [Ridder HortOS](/projects/ridder-hortos/) project is especially relevant.

## Availability

Please send me an email at [michiel@mvdm.io](mailto:michiel@mvdm.io) with details of your project so that we can start working together.

I'm currently **available** for both short and long term projects.
