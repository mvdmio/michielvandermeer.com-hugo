I developed the user interface of the EGU application. This application is responsible for handling all incoming and outgoing messages to and from ECT. If there was something wrong with incoming messages, a human operator had to correct the errors. This is what my user interface was for. I worked on-site for the entirety of this project.

For this project I had the following responsibilities:
- Communicating requirements with the on-site staff.
- Designing the solution together with my colleagues who were responsible for the other parts of the project.
- Developing and testing the product.
- Installation (every 4 weeks) and troubleshooting.

I worked with C#, ASP.NET MVC3, Entity Framework, Sharepoint 2007, BizTalk, Javascript, JQuery, KnockoutJS, PagerJS, ZURB foundation and Oracle.
