I've created a new platform for small businesses to present their business online.

In my opinion, the current solutions for building small-business websites are too difficult for small business owners. Most of the people I know are craftsmen- and women who are incredibly proficient at their craft, but not so much with the digital space. My new product and the accompanying service closes the gap between these two very different worlds. It's my goal to give small business owners a better chance at running a profitable business by helping them present their business online.
