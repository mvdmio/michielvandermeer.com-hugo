Developing container terminal automation software for PSA Antwerp, PSA Sines and PSA Voltri.

I designed, developed, documented and deployed multiple system automation projects for container terminals all over Europe. I traveled to two of these terminals for System Integration Tests (SITs) and User Acceptance Tests (UATs).

I was part of three automation projects where I had the following responsibilities
- Communicating requirements with the customer.
- Designing the solution together with two other architects.
- Overseeing the development and communicating with a team of developers about the requirements. I also developed parts of the solution myself, when time permitted.
- Installing and testing the product on-site in both Antwerp (Belgium) and Sines (Portugal).
- Integrating our software with 3rd party suppliers, both on- and off-site.
- Remote support of our solutions from our office in Barendrecht, Netherlands.

I worked with: Java 8, Spring Framework, JSP, KnockoutJS, jQuery, IntelliJ, Tomcat, Microsoft SQL, LDAP, VSTS (git and build).
