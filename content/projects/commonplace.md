Commonplace is a project that I started because I wanted a new place to organize my life, without having to worry about my data being sold to the highest bidder.

It started with me wanting to manage my book list in a single place. I had a large Google Sheet with all the books I wanted to read. However, Google is obviously the most know for finding ways to mis-use whatever you put on their platform. I found other sites not to be trustworthy either, so I created my own solution. From there, I wanted to start adding my book notes as well, so I extended the platform to include notes on my books.

With that out of the way, I noticed that I still had many other notes, links, articles, poems, and more saved in my OneNote account. I don't trust Microsoft with my data either, so I decided to make my book list platform into a single one-stop shop where everything I record can be organized. In times of old, people like Leonardo DaVinci had large notebooks where they kept all of their notes. They called these 'commonplace books.' Hence, I decided to name this my Commonplace app. An app where I can put all my 'stuff'.

If you're interested in my app, I invite you to have a look. You can create an account [here](https://commonplace.mvdm.io). It's free for 1 month, no questions asked, no credit card required. Of course, the only way I can guarantee that I won't sell your data is by asking for a monthly fee. That way I won't have to go down the advertisement hell-hole. It's $2.50 a month, or $25 a year (2 months free). You can cancel any time, no questions asked, and if you payed for a year I'll refund the months you haven't used.

I'm continually updating the app with improvements and new features. If you'd like to see something changed, please drop me an email at [mvdm@hey.com](mailto:mvdm@hey.com). I'd love to hear from you.
