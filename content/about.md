## Michiel van der Meer

I’m a professional Software Engineer, Software Architect and Team Lead. I’m currently working on high-load data analysis systems in the horticultural sector.

I'm also working on a new project, called 'Commonplace'. You can find it [here](https://commonplace.vdmeersoftware.com). It's a place where you can organize your life in a single location, without worrying about having your data sold to the highest bidder. You can try it for 14 days no questions asked, no credit card required. 

You can contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michielmeer/) or via [email](mailto:contact@michielvandermeer.com).
