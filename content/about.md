I’m a professional Software Engineer, Software Architect and Team Lead. I’m currently working on high-load data analysis systems in the horticultural sector.

I'm also working on a personal project called 'Commonplace'. You can find it [here](https://commonplace.mvdm.io). It's a place where you can organize your life in a single location, without worrying about having your data sold to the highest bidder. You can try it for 1 month, no questions asked, no credit card required. 

You can contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michielmeer/) or via [email](mailto:mvdm@hey.com).
