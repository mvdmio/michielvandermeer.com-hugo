Hi there, I am Michiel van der Meer.

Iâ€™m a professional Software Engineer, Software Architect and Team Lead with extended experience in the Industrial Automation industry. Notably, I've worked in Logistics (shipping) and Horticulture (climate computers and greenhouse data analysis). You can find all the project's I've worked on [here](/projects).

I'm also working on a personal project called 'Commonplace'. You can find it [here](https://commonplace.mvdm.io). It's a place where you can organize your life in a single location, without worrying about having your data sold to the highest bidder. You can try it for 1 month, no questions asked, no credit card required.

I write about various topics every now and then. You can find all my posts [here](/blog).

You can contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michielmeer/) or via [email](mailto:mvdm@hey.com).
